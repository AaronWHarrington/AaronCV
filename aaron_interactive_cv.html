        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            I'm a fundraising professional who has spent 15 years building relationships that matter and raising money for causes I believe in. My career has taken me from leading a $70 million campaign that exceeded its goal by $5.6 million to stepping into crisis situations where organizations needed someone who could think fast, build trust, and deliver results.
        </div>
        
        <p>What drives me is connecting with people who are tackling meaningful challenges. I get energized by those conversations where you can feel the passion behind someone's work—whether it's a university leader envisioning expanded student support or immigration advocates fighting for families navigating complex systems. There's something powerful about finding the intersection between what people care about and what organizations need to accomplish.</p>
        
        <p>I've learned that the best fundraising isn't about transactions—it's about understanding what motivates people to give and creating authentic partnerships that serve everyone involved. That philosophy has helped me build lasting relationships with donors, board members, and institutional partners who trust me to deliver on what I promise. My strength lies in being genuinely relational and finding ways to connect people's passions with organizational needs.</p>

        <h3>What Drives Results</h3>
        <p>I've raised over $70 million because I genuinely care about the missions I serve and the people I work with. My strength lies in being genuinely relational and building authentic connections that create lasting partnerships. Every major gift, every strategic partnership, every crisis I've navigated has taught me something about building trust and delivering results under pressure.</p>
        
        <p>The work I do connects me with people who are changing lives—whether it's helping a family navigate immigration, supporting students as they complete their education, or enabling a seminary to train the next generation of leaders. It's what makes every conversation meaningful and energizing.</p>
        
        <p>Most advancement professionals can either cultivate major donors or build institutional partnerships. I've proven I can do both at scale, in crisis situations, across different sectors, while maintaining the kind of donor retention rates that make CFOs smile. I'm the person who shows up when stakes are high, relationships matter, and results are non-negotiable.</p>
        
        <p>Building something that matters and delivering sustainable revenue growth only becomes reality when I genuinely care about the mission. That's when everything I do—from donor cultivation to strategic partnerships—becomes both authentic and unstoppable.</p>
